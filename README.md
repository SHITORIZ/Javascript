# Javascript
Description:
  This is a Sound Cloud Player App I did while taking the OneMonthJavascript course online.
  1)You search for artist or song
  2)When you get the resulting items you can click on add to playlist which then start to stack them up on your left
  3) You can also click on the song box direcetly which will take you to the SoundCloud website to play the song
  4) If you want to reset or start your playlist pressing clear Playlist will accomplish this
